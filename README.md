# Sensor Data Analysis

This project processes sensor data containing readings for temperature, stress, and displacement across different timestamps.

## Key Operations:
1. **Organizing Data**: Group sensor readings by sensor ID and timestamp.
2. **Extreme Value Identification**: Identify sensors with extreme values in temperature, stress, or displacement.
3. **Reading Comparison**: Compare sensor readings across time intervals and calculate changes.
4. **Data Summary**: Calculate the max, min, and average readings for each sensor.
5. **Stress Threshold Filtering**: Identify sensors with stress readings above 13.0.
6. **Timestamp Sorting**: Organize and display sensor reading timestamps.
